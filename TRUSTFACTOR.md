Different ways to increase trust factor on steam

1. Reporting spam/scam comments on other steam profiles (Best ones are st4ck https://steamcommunity.com/id/St4ck , magic https://steamcommunity.com/id/magic_vs)

2. Getting people to comment on your profile (Use purves steam service)

3. Spending money on steam (Unclear on the amount)

4. Leveling up your steam account a bunch (which is the best option as it combines options 3 and 4 if you buy csgo keys for the trading bots)

5. Sayings nice things in game chat and not being racist

6. Not getting your accounts banned as that just lowers it instantly on the new account 

Increasing trust factor works best if you do them all, it does work as I now have higher trust than everyone I play whereas I had a far lower trust before I done.

They're probably many more ways to increase it such as writing helpful steam reviews or guides and receiving likes, helping people out in steam discussions but I have not personally tried them so I'm not sure if they do anything.
